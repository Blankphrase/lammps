## The need to redo PMMA simulaiton. 

The first reason is that Prof.Philip asks me to see if I could repeat the simulation of Solomon. Plus, it is for me to learn to do simulation with lammps. 

The second reason is that after I scraped the log.lammps file to plot Pressure.It gives a very big value for pressure. **The unit Solomon choosed is real. **

After using my own bash script to scrape the potential energy, kinetic energy, pressure, volume and etc, I transformed the data from long format to wide format. 
Then, I plotted it with R. 

```{r}
